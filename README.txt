Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Network
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Handwritten digit recognition is a common application of machine learning and deep learning, and it finds its utility in various domains, including recognizing zip codes on mail envelopes and extracting amounts written on bank checks. In this project, we'll implement a multiclass classification task to classify these ten digits using Python and some popular libraries.

Libraries Used
We will be using the following Python libraries for this project:

NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays and matrices, making it an essential tool for mathematical operations in machine learning.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a versatile library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. In our project, it will help us visualize data and the performance of our neural network.

TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. We will use TensorFlow to create, train, and evaluate our neural network for handwritten digit recognition.

Getting Started
Before running the project, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow
